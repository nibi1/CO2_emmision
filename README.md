# CO2_emmision
Carbon dioxide emissions are the primary driver of global climate change. Itâ€™s widely recognised that to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, the world needs to urgently reduce emissions. But, how this responsibility is shared between regions, countries, and individuals has been an endless point of contention in international discussions.

This debate arises from the various ways in which emissions are compared: as annual emissions by country; emissions per person; historical contributions; and whether they adjust for traded goods and services. These metrics can tell very different stories.

# Problem Statement

- show the realtionship between different sources of CO2 and the correlation between Co2 and different sources gdp and population
- show the correlation between total ghg emmision and different ghg gas such as methane co2 ,nitrous oxide, emmission and gdp and population of coountries
- visualize the co2 emmision of by different continent and world over the years
- show in a tabular format co2 emmision of by different continent and world in any particular year
- visualoze the co2 mmision by different income group country
- Co2 emmision by different country and their gdp over the years.
